General Info:

    The Avalon Draconis Concord is a faction composed mainly of slow, heavily-armoured and shielded capital ships with deadly but very slow-firing long range weaponry, making them play somewhat like World War II-era battleships in space. Though they are not quick enough to outrun most enemies, their defensive capabilities are substantial, with strong armour plating, extensive point defence systems, and a single powerful shield generator on most ships.
This faction is balanced around the upper end of vanilla capabilities (not including nukes, melee, and Tinkrell), meaning that their ships are substantially more powerful than the default vanilla designs (as well as having much more P per region), but can be beaten at equal P cost by well-built ships from the stronger vanilla factions.
The Concord has several medium-sized regions throughout the map. Their regions contain an assortment of small and medium-sized ships, with each sector having a 10% chance to spawn a powerful station or capital ship such as a carrier, battlecruiser, or flagship. If you encounter one of these, be prepared for a challenging fight.


Lore:

    In the mid twenty-third century, a vast fleet of jumpships left the Sol system in a great exodus. Fed up with the constant petty wars and politicking of the Solar nations, a loose coalition of nearly two billion souls invested in a massive undertaking: an interstellar colonization effort with the intent of establishing a new bastion of humanity far from the corruption and unrest that they felt had taken hold of Sol. The separatist fleet set out into the black toward a distant star cluster where a number of habitable systems had been sighted, but the journey would be a long and arduous one, taking many years even with their superluminal warp drives.

    The problems began almost immediately. Several ships in the fleet were stricken with mechanical issues and were forced to drop out of warp only a few weeks after their departure. Their crews and passengers were transferred to other ships, leaving the fleet with an overcrowding problem which persisted throughout the journey. Further issues were caused by internal unrest, as some grew weary of the years in space and wished to return to Sol. The greatest hardship was the hijacking of the fleet's flagship, the Argo, by foreign agents who sought to force the separatists to return to their masters' control. The hijackers were eventually dealt with only by way of a surviving member of the ship's crew triggering a reactor meltdown which utterly destroyed the flagship.

    By the time the fleet finally arrived at its destination, internal strife had fractured the loose solidarity of the group, and rather than beginning by settling a single system as originally planned, the fleet split apart into several smaller groups, laying claim to systems across the Theta, Iota, and Kappa sectors. Though founding these new worlds was not an easy task, the colonists were determined not to let their great journey be in vain, and civilizations began to develop. Not as large and magnificent as those of Sol or the earlier interstellar colonies, but with their own unique identities and composed of individuals striving to build better societies than those they had left behind.

    But it was not to be. Inevitably, the darker parts of human nature caused predatory elements to emerge. The fledgling civilizations became plagued with piracy and crime — a profitable venture if one could capitalize on the lack of properly-developed military forces. The Iota Sector fell nearly in its entirety to a large confederation of pirate groups which began calling themselves the Burning Blade Ascendancy. 

    Fearing that their own nations might suffer a similar fate, the people of the Theta and Kappa sectors scrambled to mobilize a defence. The effort was spearheaded by the archipelagian world of Avalon, the Theta Sector's first and most prosperous colony — and joined shortly thereafter by Draconis, the last major planet of the Iota sector which defiantly stood against the Ascendancy. A string of early and well-publicized victories led to a great many other groups rushing to become part of this alliance, and large parts of both the Theta and Kappa sectors along with the Iotan fringe signed the agreement known as the Concord and united under a new name: the Avalon Draconis sector.

    Through the collaborative efforts of its constituent worlds, the Concord formed a powerful military force capable of standing fast against the rising tide of the Ascendancy. Millions of the best and brightest from across the sector devoted the full extent of their talents toward the design and production of weapons, warships, and the logistical infrastructure to support them. Though the ensuing conflict nearly tore the sector asunder, the Concord held firm and fought the Ascendancy to a standstill, leaving the two factions in an uneasy state of cold war which persists to this day.


Features:

- 14 ships
- 287 blocks (including size variations)
- Unusual combination of standard geometry and various kinds of triangles
- Lots of supplementary lore in the descriptions of each block


Equipment:

Repeater Cannons: Medium-range coilguns with a decent rate of fire and moderate damage per shot.
Artillery Railguns: Very long-range guns which fire multiple projectiles per shot and deal high damage with each round, but take a long time to reload.
Particle Beams: Long-range, slow-firing pulsed beam weapons which deal relatively high damage and produce minor explosive effects on impact.
Point Defence Systems: Flak cannons, charging anti-missile lasers, and heavier anti-drone turrets.
Broadside Casemate Guns: Limited arc guns with good range and explosive shells, meant for mounting en masse along the sides of ships.
Spinal Mounts: Huge, powerful weapons capable of extremely long-range bombardment and dealing massive damage with each shot. Narrow-arc swivel mountings allow for more precise aiming, and targeting lasers can be optionally attached.
Missile Launchers: Includes both agile, rapid-fire short-range missiles for killing fighters, and two types of long-range anti-capital cruise missiles.
Blueprint Drones: Two types of multi-block drones, a tiny one with a pulse laser and a fighter-sized one armed with a light repeater cannon and a more powerful pulse laser.
Strikecraft Weapons: Fixed-mount weaponry designed for small, fast fighters and bombers. Some can be modified with extended barrels and laser chambers.
Shield Generators: Powerful defensive shield projectors with high HP and moderate regeneration.
Thrusters: Heavy thrusters have a poor thrust-to-mass ratio but provide a lot of thrust for low cost, while light thrusters are the opposite.
