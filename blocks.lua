Although not all of the Concord's fleet has yet been updated in this manner, ships deployed in task forces equipped with an EDL-1 have their electronics protected by sophisticated EMP shielding to prevent friendly fire. A recently-published anthology of war poetry included the following haiku describing the EDL-1's effects:\n\nA flash of blue sparks\nDarkness split by neon light\nAll systems offline^7",
